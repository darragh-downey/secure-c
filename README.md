# Secure C Compiler

## Overview

The Secure C Compiler project aims to create a robust, secure C compiler that ensures the generated C code is safe, secure, and free from common vulnerabilities. Our goal is to push secure C code to production by integrating secure coding practices throughout the compilation process.

Optimization is not the primary focus, safety and security are.

## Goals

- **Ensure Secure Code Generation**: Generate C code that adheres to secure coding standards, mitigating risks such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and memory leaks.
- **Provide Comprehensive Analysis**: Perform thorough lexical, syntactic, semantic, and static analysis to identify and resolve potential security issues in the source code.
- **Optimize for Security and Performance**: Implement optimization techniques that enhance both the security and performance of the generated code.
- **Facilitate Secure Development Practices**: Provide tools and warnings to help developers write secure C code, replacing unsafe constructs with secure alternatives.

## Key Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenize source code while identifying and flagging unsafe patterns.
- **Parsing**: Construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with security checks for proper syntax and structure.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyze the AST for semantic correctness, ensuring type safety and proper use of identifiers.
- **Optimization**: Optimize the AST and intermediate representations for secure and efficient code generation.
- **Code Generation**: Generate machine code with built-in security features, adhering to best practices in secure coding.

## How We Aim to Achieve Our Goals

1. **Secure Coding Practices**:
   - Utilize principles from the SEI CERT division and "Secure Coding in C and C++" by Robert Seacord (for example) to guide our implementation.
   - Integrate input validation, safe memory management, and error handling into all stages of the compiler.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Structure the compiler into clear, modular components (lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, optimizer, code generator) to facilitate development, testing, and maintenance.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for each component to ensure correctness and security.
   - Conduct integration tests to verify the seamless operation of all components.
   - Use fuzz testing and static analysis tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regularly review and update the compiler to incorporate new secure coding practices and address emerging security threats.
   - Encourage community contributions to enhance the compiler's features and security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-c-compiler.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd secure-c-compiler
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```sh
   go build ./cmd/main
   ```

### Usage

To compile a C source file:

```sh
./main <source-file.c>
```

### Example

For a sample `main.c` file:

```c
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

Run the compiler:

```sh
./main main.c
```
